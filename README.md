- 👋 Hi, I am Karl Hänsel, a classical musician and student at the Meteorological Institute of the University of Hamburg, Northern Germany.

- 👀 My interests are music (notation), atmospheric science, psychology, maths, programming and literature.
- 🌱 I am currently improving my skills in Python, Fortran, LaTex and Lilypond.
